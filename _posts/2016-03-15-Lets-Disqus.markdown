I'm about to verge into a challenge to blog multiple times weekly and will post the schedule this Friday! I'm going to come up with a schedule to add a few weekly posts.  I'm tossing around ideas like "tough issues in javascript", "better know a framework", "toy problem Tuesdays", etc. I'll probably limit it two or three and see how it goes.

Tonight, I've added disqus commenting to my jekyll site so that I can get feedback from any readers I might acquire.  For those interested in using disqus on a jekyll site. The setup is fairly simple and can be found [here](https://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/472138-jekyll-installation-instructions).

I've been working with a lot smart people recently and it is clear that collaboration can yield some incredible results. Hopefully, this little addition of a comment thread will keep the ideas flowing. If anyone want to add an idea feel free to hit me up below in the new comments!
