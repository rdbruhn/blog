I spent last night building this new blog using jekyll and github pages. I migrated over the post data and hope to begin tweaking the styles and features a lot more going forward. The setup process was helpful and got me used the command line a bit more. I'm looking forward to being able to customize the site more than the wordpress.com site I had before. 
In other news I've been learning a lot about Node.js and hope to finish a class on Angular.js this week. If I can get enough understanding of every component, I hope to build my first project using the MEAN stack before my Hack Reactor cohort starts the immersive on the 29th. I can't wait to get started!
