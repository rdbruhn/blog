I'm a software engineer with a strong foundation in Javascript. I have built, enhanced, and deployed applications using technologies including Angular, Backbone, Node, Express, MongoDB, RethinkDB and MySQL. I am quick to learn whatever tool or framework is needed for a given challenge. I enjoy Agile development and solving complex problems in a team environment. I am currently interested in part-time or contract work and will be seeking full-time employment Aug. 29th.
